# leetcode
Some basic leetcode problems you may encounter. Should work for the most part however there are definetly better ways to solve most of them. 

1. Anagram: Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. 

2. IsPrime: Tests to see whether or not a number is prime by checking the divisibilty and remainder. Prime numbers should only be divisble by 1 and themselves.

3. AddTwoNumbers: Given two lists with digits stored in reversed order, output their sum (non-reversed) and return the reversed value to a 3rd list.
